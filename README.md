The main application is named Railway Ticket Management System.py.

This project is a train ticket booking and management system implemented in Python, likely using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL for the database. The system allows users to book train tickets, verify their PNR (Passenger Name Record), and perform web check-ins. Here’s a breakdown of its main functionalities:



Database Setup:


Creates a login database with an info table to store user login information, including userid (primary key) and password.


Booking Tickets:


Users can book train tickets by providing details such as the source, destination, date, number of passengers, and class.
The system checks available trains and seats, then allows the user to fill in personal details like name, age, sex, contact number, and Aadhar number.
Once the details are filled and verified, the booking is confirmed, and a PNR is generated.


PNR Verification:


Users can verify their booking details by entering their PNR and Aadhar number.
If the details match the records, the system displays the booking details.
Web Check-in:

Users can perform web check-ins by entering their PNR and contact number.
The system updates the check-in status to "Confirmed" (CNF) or "Cancelled" (CNL) based on the user’s input.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The system uses Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface with various forms and labels for input and output.
It provides a seamless experience for booking, verifying, and checking in for train tickets.
Database Interaction:

The system interacts with the MySQL database to store and retrieve booking information, update seat availability, and manage user login credentials.


Saving the files:
Create a new folder on your computer and name it something like "Railway Ticket Management System".
Save Files

This should include your Python script (named RailwayTicketManagementSystem.py) and any other necessary files.

Setting up MySQL Database:
Install MySQL if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
Launch MySQL and open a connection.
Create a Database
